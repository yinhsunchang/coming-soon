# Coming Soon Landing Page

A visually appealing "Coming Soon" landing page built with Vite, React, and TypeScript. It features an animated slideshow, typing effect, countdown timer, email subscription, and a fully responsive layout—ideal for product launches or personal brands.

All photos were taken and edited by me, highlighting a combination of my photography skills and modern frontend development expertise.
